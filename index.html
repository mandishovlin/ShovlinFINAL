<p> Physical education is a critical part of early education, teaching kids the importance of exercise and how to properly take care of their bodies. These programs also aim to foster a safe environment for students to successfully learn how to practice and implement an active lifestyle. Physical education builds a foundation for students as they grow to become adults, learning how to properly take care of themselves. 
 </p>

<p> Unfortunately, “core” classes like math, science, english and history overshadow the importance of physical and health education. If a school district requires more attention to one of these subjects, often the first class or period to be discarded is P.E.. 
<p>

<p> However, being physically fit and healthy can benefit the student beyond what many can comprehend. The connection between physical education and social emotional learning is becoming ever more prominent in today’s education, creating well rounded students. 
</p>

<p> With over 1.2 million students and 1,500 schools, New York City school districts face the most hurdles and strategic planning for their wide variety of students. Although curriculums are state mandated, <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/">The New York City Department of Education</a> takes into account socioeconomic class, neighborhood, population, etc. when curating more specific lesson plans. </p>

<p> “It’s a vital subject area that should be taught in every single school in America. It should be taught 5 days a week and should meet the requirements of 120 minutes, if not more, a week,” says Dr. Victor Ramsey. 
</p>

<p> 
Dr. Victor Ramsey, an adjunct professor at York College’s Department of Health and Human Performance, is now a retired educational administrator. After serving 33 years in the New York City Department of Education he believes in the power of a suggested curriculum, not a required one. </p>

<p> “It is based on the teacher extrapolating information from all over, putting together a comprehensive, culturally relevant, instructional plan for all students, where all students feel welcome,” says Ramsey. 
</p>

<p> 
The importance of this type of education in addition to core subjects is the effect of the daily <a href="https://thephysicaleducator.com/shop/dose-poster/">D.O.S.E.</a> of physical education has on students. Each letter in D.O.S.E. stands for a certain chemical that is released in the body when the body receives the suggested amount of physical movement or exercise. Dopamine builds motivation, improves long-term memory, and increases creativity. Oxytocin helps develop trust, maintains optimism, and promotes social skills. Serotonin boosts your mood, regulates sleep cycles and encourages good decisions. Endorphins provide a sense of euphoria, helps to manage pain, and supports stress management. 
</p>

<p> According to the New York City Department of Education, in the 2020-21 school year the percentage of elementary aged students in all five boroughs who received physical education instruction in all terms is 99% or higher. Staten Island leads with a 99.76% instruction rate. 
</p>

<p> Although the data proves otherwise, some may raise concerns about the accuracy of the data due to the socioeconomic fluctuation and urban setting of New York City. A rate over over 99% may lead researchers to raise an eyebrow. </p>

<p> “Who is entering it there is one thing, is it physically happening is another thing,” says Ramsey. 
</p>

<p> According to Ramesy the NYC Department of Education asks schools for a minimum of days per week for every child and asks for a set amount of minutes they participate in physical education. They provide these goals to give them opportunities to reach that threshold. On paper it might sound ideal because someone is entering that data, but when a visit is paid to schools they might see only P.E. four, three or even two days a week.
</p>

<p> However, Ramesy points out that this is not to say the data is not completely accurate. On paper the data is an accurate representation of the reports according to the school’s principal. According to the honor system of these reports, they may be more of an optimistic take rather than inaccurate. 
</p>

<p> Additionally, one of the most common struggles throughout the New York City schools systems is the lack of space and the inequity in funding. The lack of space in New York City schools is a common issue, but not one that can’t be solved with some creativity. Using C.O.B. (Community Based Resources), like Asphalt Green, helps students get active during their recess time. Educators are also using cafeterias, make-shift gymnasiums and even theater-based stages to create spaces for physical education. According to Ramsey a lack of funding and resources can lead to issues such as not being able to hire actual certified physical educators. </p>

<p> The landscape of urban education is changing before our eyes. Non-traditional sports and activities are being taught. From a cultural standpoint, an outsider may think basketball, soccer and football is taught in New York City schools. In addition, it may shock some that activities like surfing, skiing and even archery are being taught in these schools as well. 
</p>

<p> “Those are things I would like anyone looking from outside New York City to see these things. I think it plays out a very important role in the development, overall development, and learning outcome of students,” said Ramsey.  </p>
